We had to choose a specific Rotterdam theme and target group as a team. We received this assignment, because most freshmen do not know much about design yet. As a designer you want the current situation to be changed to the desired situation.",

My tasks were mainly graphic, because my team knew that I have knowledge about graphic design. I made the corporate identity for this project. During the Design Challenge I have built up a lot of knowledge and, more importantly, knowledge that I also had during the project. What gave me the most knowledge and helped listening to research, paper - prototyping, blogging and analysis.",

I was more open to change and I also learned to look critically at the information I have looked up. That it does not matter if you have researched certain information but ultimately did not do anything with it.",
